# OBody Standalone NG
Edited version of https://github.com/Sairion350/OBody to allow using without installing OStim.

This version of OBody contains a DLL file which was compiled with CommonLibSSE NG, meaning that this single DLL file will work on every version of Skyrim, including the Anniversary Edition versions.

For the SKSE C++ source code used to build the DLL file, [click here](https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-NG).

OBody Standalone NG release build can be found on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016).
